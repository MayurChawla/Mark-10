why use label.?
    - good practise
    - otherwise u would use div but for screen readers it is not helpful
    - label is more helpful for screen readers
# label has a tag "for" it is to connect the label to the desired tag(markup) in html


<caption> tag inside table would provide the description for the table
    - also good for semantics

document.queryselector can be used to get the html tag from the html code and acces it in the js file
